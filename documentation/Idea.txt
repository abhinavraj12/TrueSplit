MongoDB Compass for database management

#Web Frontend
React 18 with TypeScript
Tailwind CSS for styling
Axios for API calls
React Query for state management

#Mobile App
React Native with TypeScript
Expo for faster development
React Navigation for navigation

#Development & Deployment
Docker for containerization
Postman for API testing
Git for version control
AWS/Google Cloud etc... for deployment

1. Authentication Flow

User Opens App → Login/Signup → JWT Token Generated → Token Stored → Authenticated Requests


2. Group Management Flow

User Logs In → Dashboard → Create/Join Group → Add Members → Group Ready for Expenses


3. Expense Management Flow

Select Group → Add Expense → Choose Split Type → Save → Balance Recalculated → Notifications




📊 Detailed Application Flow
Phase 1: Onboarding & Setup
Web/Mobile Flow:

// Both platforms follow same flow
1. Landing Page → Sign Up → Email Verification → Login
2. Dashboard Empty State → "Create Your First Group"
3. Create Group → Add Group Name & Description → Invite Members
4. Members Join via Email/Invite Link → Group Active

Backend API Endpoints (used by both):
java
@PostMapping("/auth/register")     // Both web & mobile use same endpoint
@PostMapping("/auth/login")        // Same authentication for both
@PostMapping("/groups")           // Create group - same for both
@PostMapping("/groups/{id}/invite") // Invite members - same for both



Phase 2: Expense Management
Adding Expense Flow:
User Action → API Call → Database Update → Balance Calculation → Response

sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend (Web/Mobile)
    participant B as Backend
    participant DB as MongoDB

    U->>F: Clicks "Add Expense"
    F->>B: POST /api/expenses
    B->>DB: Save expense
    B->>B: Calculate new balances
    B->>DB: Update balances
    B->>F: Return success + updated balances
    F->>U: Show updated UI


Phase 3: Balance Settlement
Settlement Flow:
text
View Balances → See Who Owes Whom → Initiate Settlement → Mark as Paid → Update Balances
